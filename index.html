      Artificial Intelligence (AI) has long been one of the most debated topics in modern technology, partly due to its exceedingly vast capabilities and potential, but mostly – and more importantly – due the fear of what those capabilities could cause. Having immeasurable power for calculation and computation, today’s AI tools are already competent in completing complex tasks, that would take most humans many hours, in just mere seconds. With a global market value of $241 billion in 2023 and an expected tenfold increase by 2030 to bring its global value close to $2 trillion (Statista, 2023), it is no wonder that great intellects such as Steven Hawking warn that AI will “outperform humans” and “could spell the end of the human race”. As we watch AI become increasingly common in our world, should we embrace the changes and ease it brings to our lives, or should we become increasingly weary of its intelligence and seemingly boundless growth?

      With no doubt, AI enhances our lives in many different aspects. Robots created for human assistance such as Siri, Alexa and other various chatbots have become integral parts of our daily lives and are used in a wide range of situations (Wirtz et al, 2018). Beyond simple and mundane tasks, AI’s application to industry has been revolutionary. One of the biggest impacts has been on the medicinal world which has reaped huge benefits from AI, particularly in diagnosis. Where a doctor takes years of learning and experience to develop their diagnosis skills, an AI model can be trained in a matter of weeks. A study conducted by Seoul National University Hospital found that the deep-learning AI model they had developed was able to analyse chest radiographs and detect abnormal cell growth and potential cancers. Not only was its diagnosis correct but it outperformed 17 out of 18 trained physicians (Nam and Park et al., 2018). It’s this very element of ‘training vs performance’ which makes AI so profound, in that the amount of training it needs to reach human-level or beyond performance at a task is miniscule in comparison to the amount of time humans need training. Not only that but the level of performance it can reach is not limited by human factors, meaning in many tasks – often pattern recognition or data analysis – AI rapidly surpasses human ability (Time magazine, 2023)

		As shown by the above figure, AI models have surpassed 100% human ability in pattern recognition tasks since the mid 2010’s and as we approach the mid 2020’s AI models are reaching maximum human ability at more complex tasks such as mathematical calculations and text or code generation. 
In its current state, AI is mostly used for support under human control and guidance to complete tasks that are heavily processing-based in which a computer has a far obvious advantage over a human, rather than completely replacing the human role. The finance world is one of the biggest examples of this, where AI models have been integrated into their work to handle large data-processing and market trend analysis. Training AI models to recognise fraudulent payments, risks with loans, and probability of investment success has majorly enhanced the work rate and efficiency of many banks globally and is estimated to have saved $447 billion in costs (Insider Intelligence, 2023). Not just finance but almost every industry in the world has begun to implement AI into their services and benefited greatly from its use (Statista, 2023). The table below shows the adoption of AI worldwide, by industry and function:

		Accenture conducted a report comparing the baseline expected profit of industries up until 2035 to their expected profit with AI implementation. The leading industries were:
-	Education: 84%
-	Accommodation and food services: 74%
-	Construction: 71%
-	Wholesale and retail: 59% 
-	Healthcare: 55%
(Accenture, 2017 as cited in Techopedia, 2023)
The prospects and benefits of AI are clear: immense potential for growth and development, increasing implementation in society, undisputed benefits for a wide range of industry, and substantial increases in profits. Education coming out on top with an expected 84% increase in profits with AI usage rather un-intuitively leads us right into the darker side of AI’s growth. Putting economic growth and profit aside, there are essential ethical, moral and even environmental concerns when it comes to AI. Education in particular has been notably affected by the recent development of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. The ability of generative AI has increased remarkably over the years with the most recent release of ChatGPT v4 being the most advanced language-based AI model today with the ability to read, understand and write entire texts. In an entire new generation of students, 43% report using ChatGPT for assignments and exams, affecting their standard of education by their use of generative AI to replace their own work and potentially affecting the standards and abilities of the future workforce (TechBusinessNews, 2023).
